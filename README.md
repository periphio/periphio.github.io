# periphio.github.io

This repo handles the redirects from prph.io/{whatever} 

Each folder in this repo is a seperate redirect, and the index.html in the root is a redirect for prph.io->periphio.com

i.e. if folder is called mypage this will redirect prph.io/mypage to what is specified in the index.html in the folder.

To add another redirect:
1. Create a new folder named what you want the redirect url to be
2. Copy the index.html from the root into your folder
3. Edit the links in the new index.html
4. Commit changes
5. it works!
